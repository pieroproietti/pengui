# penGUI

penGUI take cure of eggs!

## start
This project started near the end of the year, due my necessity to improve my ability with python and learn about GUI.

I tried - same time ago - to use electron, but at last I'm seeng python have again possibility, more than I wait and the results are light. 

# state of the art
At the moment just the dialog produce is implemented and connected to the penGUI, I have another two widget: eggs_configuration, already working and terminal to invent again.

With produce, just select File ->Produce, you can compose the command in a GUI, then copy and paste the result in a terminal.

For now, 30 december 2023 is enought!

# packaging
I was able to package pengui, but not yet working, just the main window show, but don't load dialogs installing on a system. 

**Note**: on my development is working, but need to understand that I must bring in the package more.
