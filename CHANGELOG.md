# CHANGELOG
This project started near the end of the 2023, due my necessity to improve my ability with python and learn about GUI and pyside6.

I tried - same time ago - to use electron, but at last eventually I decided to try it again in python, and I am seeing good results in terms of lightness and practicality of development.

# Versions
