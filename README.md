# penGUI

penGUI take cure of eggs! 

penGUI makes it easy for you to learn eggs commands, once you learn them you will probably use it less, but a GUI for penguins-eggs was needed and now there is.

I'm using python 3.11.2 and PySide6 to build the program.

## Prerequisites (Debian bookworm)

Just installed this packages:

`sudo apt install build-essential`

`sudo apt install python3-full python-is-python3`

It seem we need for QT following packages: 
`sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 libpython3.11` 

# venv
Just run `./bin/create_venv and` follow the instructions for install packages.

# Following notes are not yet implemented

## poetry
I will like to manage the package with `poetry`, perhaps simply for poetry!

* `sudo apt install pipx`
* `pipx ensurepath`
* `pipx install poetry`
* `poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion`

## pydantic
I come from typescript and love to declare variables and get help from editors. Probably pydantic will offer something.
